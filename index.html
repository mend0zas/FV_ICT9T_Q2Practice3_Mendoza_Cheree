                            <td>Saiki Kusuo is a quiet and expressionless high school student born with overwhelming psychic powers such as telepathy, telekinesis, precognition, and more. Although he appears detached, he is extremely intelligent and observant, constantly trying to avoid attention and live a peaceful, ordinary life. However, his powers and the eccentric people around him always pull him into chaotic situations, forcing him to use his abilities while still trying to remain unnoticed. Despite his calm demeanor, he has a soft spot for coffee jelly and secretly cares about the people around him.</td>

                            <td>Kokomi Teruhashi is the school’s most beautiful and admired girl, known for her goddess-like appearance, politeness, and flawless image that captivates everyone she meets. She is confident—often to the point of narcissism—and fully expects people to fall in love with her on sight. Her perfect façade occasionally slips, especially around Saiki, who is the only person completely unaffected by her charm, making her fascinated and determined to win his attention. Beneath her vanity, Kokomi is thoughtful in her own dramatic way and tries to maintain her reputation as the “perfect girl.”</td>

                            <td>Riki Nendou is a large, muscular student with a tough appearance but an incredibly simple and kind heart. Although he is academically challenged and often clueless about what’s happening around him, he is extremely loyal and always eager to help his friends. He considers Saiki his best friend and constantly tries to include him in conversations and activities, much to Saiki’s frustration since he cannot read Nendou’s mind like everyone else’s. Despite his lack of intelligence, Nendou’s sincerity, bravery, and compassion make him one of the most lovable characters in Saiki’s chaotic life.</td>
